YetiJS
======

YetiJS is a JavaScript framework that provides utitlity to write HTML5-Games faster and easier.
It was initially planned to work in combination with CocoonJS, but I'm focusing on major browsers right now because smartphones lack performance at the moment.

Note: YetiJS is in a very early stage, many things are missing or not fully implemented by now, and there is no learning material.

Dependencies
------
YetiJS uses a few libraries and tools:

- Box2DWeb, a JavaScript port of the beautiful Box2D physics library
- SAT (Separating Axis Theorem) from Jim Riecken is a vary fast way to check if convex polygons collide
- vector2d, a slightly modified version of Tudor Nita's 2D vector library
- yuicompressor, to compress the final js-file

Documentation
------
I used JSDoc 3 (https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) to create a class-documentation similar to javadoc. It will be accessible soon here: http://leoz.ch/yetijs/doc

------
I have put together a project template you just have to download and begin developing.
